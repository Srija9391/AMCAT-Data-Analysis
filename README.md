**Description:**  This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on an AMCAT dataset to uncover insights related to salary distribution, job roles, and specializations. The dataset includes information on employee salaries, designations, job cities, education, and various psychological traits. Through univariate and bivariate analyses, along with hypothesis testing, key trends in salary patterns and relationships between specialization and gender are explored.

**Key Features:**

**Univariate Analysis**: Examines the distribution of key variables like salary, college GPA, and specialization.

**Bivariate Analysis**: Explores relationships between variables such as GPA and salary, degree and salary, using scatter plots, box plots, and bar plots.

**Hypothesis Testing**: Conducts t-tests and chi-square tests to assess differences in salaries and specialization-gender relationships.

**Visualizations**: Utilizes Seaborn and Matplotlib for data visualizations to depict trends and distributions.
